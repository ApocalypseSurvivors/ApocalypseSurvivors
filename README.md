## Puzzle 2 (Kangcheng Chen)
### Description
Puzzle 2, created by Kangcheng Chen, is a key-finding game.
In the room, the clue is a photo on the wall. From the clue, the player needs to grab the correct book and place it in the right place to unlock the door. 
The game works as intended. However, given more time, I could have polished it by adding better models(book and shelf models) and diversions. The clue does not have to be a photo but can be any object related to the book.

## Puzzle 3 (Xi Peng)
### Description
Puzzle 3, created by Xi Peng, is followed as a logic deduction game.
There are two doors (one red and one black) in the room. The player must select the correct one to escape the room.
The secret of the correct answer is hidden on the wall. Three pioneers left some clues to cue the player for the right way out.
However, the pioneer may lie to you. Don't get tricked by the evil!
